    <h1>Welcome to ComplianceGPT</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      Financial institutions have to be on top of a plethora of laws and guidelines. </br>
    Sometimes, this means that while processes as stipulated in SOPs are being followed, those processes are outdated. </br> 
    We believe that GenAI can be a powerful companion in quick QnA on specific laws, as a means of drafting new SOPs 
    and also as a way to perform gap-anayses on current SOPs. </br>Therefore, we've developed ComplianceGPT. </br>
    It is still in development mode ‚Äî but feel free to test it out! We are continuously adding new laws to it. 
  </br> (And obviously, it should not be considered as a legal foundation in any way, shape or form!)
